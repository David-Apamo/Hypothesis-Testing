# Hypothesis-Testing
This repository contains a collection of statistical tests for A/B testing and their implementation in R. These tests are essential tools for analyzing data, comparing groups and making informed decisions based on empirical evidence.

# Usage
The following R packages should be installed prior to running the code in this repository; tidyverse, janitor, readxl, BSDA, skimr, pwr, epitools. Each test in this repository is implemented with clear, easy-to-follow R code. Detailed examples and usage instructions are provided in the respective folders. Users can leverage these tests to perform robust statistical analysis on their datasets.
